I often use [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) to track my spend time on what I do.  
So i decide to create extensions for chrome to simplify this process in Azure DevOps.

In the past I wrote one simple extension for personal use, but my knowleadge was limited.

So I decide to challenge [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) to create this extension for me.  
After 2 hours I finished MVP and it works.

On the page extension adds a button to start a timer.
