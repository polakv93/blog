Nginx native use two files for handling ssl certificate in `nginx.conf`.

```conf
ssl_certificate     /etc/ssl/cert.pem;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private.key;
```

But most of the vendors sells certificate in `.pfx` format with password,  
so to convert we first needs to install `openssl` and then extract the private key
```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in certificate.pfx -nocerts -nodes -out private.key
```
and extract certificate key via
```bash
openssl pkcs12 -in certificate.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out cert.pem
```

Next replace old files with new and restart nginx :D

Of course better is to use nginx certbot with let's encrypt but this is not always possible.
