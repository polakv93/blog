On everyday i use Glove80 as my main keyboard.  
But I had a problem with it and i need to wait 2 weeks for replacement part. (Issue was fixed with support in one day but shipping...)  
So I was forced to use regular one.  
I use vim motions whenever possible, this means I don't like to use arrow keys.  
I was looking for a way to turn regular keyboard into programmable keyboard and I found Kanata.
